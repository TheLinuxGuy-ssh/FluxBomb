<p align="center">A free and open-source SMS/Call bombing application</p>

## Announcement

---
## NOTES:


> **Due to the overuse of script, a bunch of APIs have been taken offline. It is okay if you do not receive all the messages.**

> **Termux version from Play Store is not supported since 2019, please use the latest version from F-Droid Store!**


- The application requires active internet connection to contact the APIs
- You would not be charged for any SMS/calls dispatched as a consequence of this script
- For best performance, use single thread with considerable delay time
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version of FluxBomb and have Python 3
- This application must not be used to cause harm/discomfort/trouble to others
- By using this, you agree that you cannot hold the contributors responsible for any misuse

## Compatibility
Check your Python version by typing in
```shell script
$ python --version
```
If you get the following
```shell script
Python 3.8.3
```
or any version greater than or equal to 3.4, this script has been tested and confirmed to be supported. For obsolete versions of Python (eg 2.7), use discretion while executing the script as it has not been tested there.
